# Hawaii Climate Analysis App
Module 10 SQLAlchemy Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining weather observations from nine different weather stations including temperature and precipitation.
We have a python notebook that contains starter code for the climate app.
We created a python app made with Flask that lets you search through different pages to find different information on the weather.

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my SQLAlchemy, Flask and SQLite knowledge.
I looked at two sql tables, measurements and stations, using SQLAlchemy ORM and analyzed the data using SQLite queries.
Then, I created the Flask app that used those queries on the different web pages.

The file types in this repository are csv files, a sqlite file, a python file and a ipynb file.
